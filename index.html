<div class="mySlides">
  <q>Everything has come crashing down around you. Your family has completely
  let go of you. All their hope in you has been squandered. You allowed every
  opportunity presented to you to slip through your fingers and effectively ruined
  your future. It started with drinking. Your mom heard bottles clanking in your room
  when you were attempting to dispose of the evidence. That was strike one. They watched you
  like a hawk from then on. No more easy access. No more evening healing elixir. Once you
  lost the ability to numb yourself every other aspect of your existence began to shatter around you.
  The domino effect is catastrophic in your little world. Your grades at university decline rapidly.
  Exams are outright skipped, homework assignments are no longer even acknowledged and within the course
  of a month your professors, advisors, and counselors are frantically trying to push you back on track,
  but their concerns float away from you. It is as if you are submerged in water and can only hear
  muffled screaming. Sleep evades you. You have forgotten how to sleep on your own.
  Your level of dependence is astounding in such a short time. As your grades submerge to a point of
  no return your parents begin to threaten you. If you are unable to complete the semester you will
  be kicked out of the family home. How dare you bring this bummy behavior into their home around
  your younger siblings? It's outlandish.

<div class="mySlides">
  <q>As a few weeks pass, you realize it would be in your best interest to drop out of university rather
  than face the inevitable failures to come. AFter the news of your withdrawal from the term reaches
  your parents they stick to their word and order you out of their house by the end of the week.
  You rack up as many spare dollars as you can as the week drags on and begin to pack up your belongings
  into your car. Once the night of the last day comes you leave. You exit wordlessly, your parents standing in
  the doorway, and you drop your house keys on the sidewalk. You drive until you no longer recognize your surroundings.
  You end up in a neighborhood that seems to be made up of factories and dilapidated buildings. You located a motel
  but the sign indicated you could not afford more than a night. It was not worth it so you slept in your car in the parking
  lot. You were so mentally exhausted from the ordeal at home but physically you were on high alert. You had no idea how the first
  night would pan out nor the ones to follow. Fear was gripping you as you fell into the hellscape of being half asleep
  and half awake. Your dreams blend into reality and dark figures knock at the windows of your car. You jolt up at each knock but sleepiness
  lulls you back down. As the sky lightens and you rise and begin to wonder if what you experienced was even real. Those figures
  tormented you. You knew they were only people but something about their presence disturbed you deeply. There was a sense of evil
  shrouded in the silence of their surroundings. You realized that they may return and decided to wait up. You first had to survive
  your first day of homelessness. You located a shower at a nearby truck stop and scrounged up loose change from the crevices of your car
  and get a cup of coffee and a donut from a gas station. You bum a cigarette off a stranger as night approaches in hopes of keeping
  yourself awake. As the sun begins to dip below the horizon your anticipation grows and you lie in wait for your mystery tormentor.

<div class="mySlides">
  <q>The passenger seat of your car is your bed for the night. You extend the back until it is parallel to the ground and lay out clothes
  and the single blanket you have as a makeshift bed. You lie with your eyes peeled open staring at the windshield. The illuminated green
  clock on the dashboard displays 12:04 A.M. Your eyes begin to feel heavy but you begin to feel sleep overtake you slowly. Too soon. There
  is a sharp rap at the window next to your head. You jolt up and try to let your eyes adjust to the darkness. The figure on the other side
  of the window was dressed in all black and only half of their face is visible. They have a stud sticking through their lip but that is their
  only distinctive feature. You rise slowly and open the door to speak with them. Your insides felt as though they were liquifying as
  you inched closer to them. You tried to speak to them but they had very little to say. All you could hear was a price. Twenty five
  dollars for the best night of sleep you will ever get in your life. Your body and mind were on autopilot and you agreed.
  You thank yourself internally for not caving into a motel your first night out. They hand you a crumpled up brown baggie that is much larger
  than expected and nod at you as they walk away. You get back into your car and carefully open the bag to inspect the contnts of it.
  Inside was a baggie filled with white powder. There was also a drugstore syringe and severely burnt spoon. You turned around to see if
  the dealer was still visible in the parking lot but they were gone. You wonder why he had been so generous and provided you with tools.
  Instead of questioning it further you decided to just go through with it. With the initial hit, something took hold over you. It sunk
  its claws in and it would be damned if anything was going to tear it out of you. You start to drift into the most blissful, serene
  sleep of your entire life and any potential past and afterlives. The evil began to form a cloud around you so thick it was going to
  become hard to breathe.

<div class="mySlides">
  <q>You have lost track of how much time you spent homeless. You long since sold your car and pawned any small items that were not completely
  essential, like the one pair of clothes you wear daily. You traded everything for more and more peaceful nights of rest. Everytime
  you met the dealer, your initial tormentor the look on their face was more and more smug, depite only being visible from the nose down.
  You were sleeping under a highway overpass in a stolen tent. It reeked of bodily fluids and was covered in burn holes from when you would fall asleep
  with lit cigarettes still in your hand. You had become a theif and a vagrant. You lived beyond the outskirts of society and no one else's habit
  seemed nearly as all consuming as yours. You felt as though you were contained in your little bubble and were completely untouchable. No one
  could knock you off of cloud nine. Until they finally do. You're sitting in your usual spot near your tent when cops emerge from the sparse woods
  surrounding you. You trusted those woods for camoflauge and safety and they failed you. Maybe they would have moved along, had they not seen
  you actively injecting yourself with the syringe. You didn't have time to remove it from your vein. You took off running as fast as you could.
  Adrenaline defied all of the depressants in your system and kept you moving but they overtook you quickly. You are tackled to ground.
  Your vision becomes black and fuzzy around the edges until everything goes dark. When you awake again you are in a cell. A drunk tank.
  A few others are in there with you but are passed out. You follow suit and return to sleep. The hours of intake into jail are excruciating.
  Your body is quickly starting to enter withdrawal and you feel the physical craving taking over your body and feel the cold sweats and sickness
  quickly take control. You have become feeble and weak. You start to slump to the floor. Perhaps you were someone whose addiction was beginning
  to keep them alive. Your vision is slowly reduced to a pinhole as you lie on the dirty floor of a county jail cell. Your thoughts run wild
  as your brain begins to trip out knowing its death is imminent. The one thought that displays and flashes itself in giant neon letters across
  the forefront of your thoughts is "What If. "

<div class="mySlides">
  <q> When you wonder who could have possibly been so damaged and changed within
    a matter of months and how quickly life can begin to spiral so severely and miserably
    out of control look no further. You're right there. Addiction can't
    discriminate now can it?</q>
